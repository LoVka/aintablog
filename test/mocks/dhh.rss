    <title>In it for the long haul</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Announcing &lt;a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2008/1/29/railsconf-08-registration-is-open"&gt;RailsConf '08&lt;/a&gt; today, I stopped to think about that by the time this conference rolls around, I will have been working on Ruby on Rails for five years. Wow. There are so many memories from this wild ride that it's at once both hard to fathom that it's been so long and yet it feels like I've been doing it forever. Time can be funny like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what pleases me the most is that I still absolutely love working on and with Ruby and Rails. It didn't pass, it wasn't just a phase, it wasn't a run for an exit event. I think that's significant because it means that I, and everyone else still involved with the project, are just as likely to keep at this for another five years or more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you do what you love for the sake of itself, the rewards are so much greater than if you just do it for external incentives. For lots of measures of "winning", we've long since won with Ruby on Rails. The impact on the industry, the adoption by thousands of companies and developers, the books, the conferences, and all that jazz. And yet, it doesn't really matter that much in the end. What matters is getting excited about continuing the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of this, I strongly recommend that you find a vocation in your life where you just really enjoy the act itself. Not just the results, not just the external incentives. The actual work. There's not enough time to spend it doing anything else.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>The deal with shared hosts</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Most Rails contributors are not big users of shared hosting and they tend to work on problems or enhancements that'll benefit their own usage of the framework. You don't have to have a degree in formal logic to deduce that work to improve life on shared hosting is not exactly a top priority for these people, myself included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's not a value judgement. It's not saying that shared hosting is bad or evil. It's simply saying that the Rails contributors generally don't use it. By extension, it's not something that we are personally invested in solving as a traditional "scratch your own itch" type of development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Improve what is for profit and fun&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I'd love for Rails to be easy as pie to run in a shared hosting environment, though. I'd love for Rails to be easy as pie to run in any environment. In that "more people could have fun learning Rails and deploying their first hobby application" kind of way. But I don't &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; it in the sense that I'm going to put in the work, personally, to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others might, though. The Dreamhost guys in particular &lt;a href="http://blog.dreamhost.com/2008/01/07/how-ruby-on-rails-could-be-much-better/"&gt;sounds like they're experiencing a lot of hurt&lt;/a&gt; running Rails in their shared hosting environments. That should be a great motivator to jump in and help improve things. The work I do every day to improve Rails is usually about removing hurt. Heck, it's currently in the slogan on the Rails site: "Web development that doesn't hurt".
&lt;br /&gt;  
&lt;br /&gt;Second, it sounds like they have a substantial economic interest in making the shared hosting scenario for Rails easier. I read that a fair number of their customers are going elsewhere because they can't get Rails to run well at Dreamhost. Before they leave, though, they probably tax the support system quite heavily as well. So there's direct costs, lost revenues, and probably also a great upside waiting if Rails ran great on their system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's both a personal motive for having a less stressful day and a profit motive for making your business more money. Sounds like a match made in heaven for someone like Dreamhost to get involved and help do the work to make Rails a great shared host experience. They might not have the man-power in-house today to make that happen, but I'm sure they could easily hire their way out of that. If the plan they want to pursue is a better mod_ruby, I'd start looking at that project for people who've contributed and ask if they'd like to earn a living improving the state of affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;We'll work with you if you're willing to work with us&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Again, I'd love to see someone tackle this challenge and would be more than happy to work with a group pursuing this to get their results into Rails or working with Rails the best way we can. Consider that an open, standing invitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In exchange, I'll ask a few, small favors. Don't treat the current Rails community as your unpaid vendor. Wipe the wah-wah tears off your chin and retract the threats of imminent calamity if we don't drop everything we're doing to pursue your needs. Stop assuming that it's either a "complete lack of understanding of how web hosting works, or an utter disregard for the real world" that we're not working on issues that would benefit your business. Think of it more as we're all just working on the issues that matters most to our business or interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The alternatives&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Now if you're a user of shared hosting and you're not satisfied with the results you're getting &amp;mdash; and you're not getting good vibes that things will be better &amp;mdash; there are alternatives. Lots of them in fact. And it doesn't have to cost an arm and a leg. Self-service VPS outfits like &lt;a href="http://www.slicehost.com/"&gt;Slice Host&lt;/a&gt; has plans starting at $20/month that runs Rails great (I use them to run this site). &lt;a href="http://railsmachine.com/"&gt;RailsMachine&lt;/a&gt; has a Rails-specific setup for $75/month. And for the more high-end stuff, you can get great setups from &lt;a href="http://www.joyent.com"&gt;Joyent&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.engineyard.com/"&gt;Engine Yard&lt;/a&gt;, and tons of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as a programmer looking to deploy Rails, you have tons of options in all price ranges. If you're a shared host looking to capitalize on a framework that's driving a lot of demand, it would seem that your best option is to actually get involved and help the community help you. &lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Don't overestimate the power of versions</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've long been impressed and puzzled by the power of big version numbers. To open source projects like Ruby on Rails, it's such a divorced measure of quality or features that I feel we need to take it's importance down a few notches. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, nothing magical happens when a certain revision of the code base is blessed with a release. It's simply the decision that what we have now should have a label. So when edge revision 8441 is given the alias of Rails 2.0.2, it's just that, an alias.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other realms of software development, it might very well imply a large amount of release preparation. Some projects and products go months in a strict feature-freeze mode where only bugs are sought out. Most open source software doesn't adhere to something this stringent, Rails certainly doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only real software-related attribute of versions for Rails is to communicate issues of backwards compatibility. Slapping 2.0 on something is a license to break existing code that has been deprecated in the past. But this really happens so very rarely that it hardly deserves big attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this is not to say that versions are meaningless, just that they're more about culture and information than about the quality of software. Having a big release is a worthy way of celebrating that things have moved forward since last time we did a release. And to give people a chance to catch up on all the new features. That's great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the problem is that lots of people, especially clients paying the bills of consultants, are overestimating the value of these release names to the point of avoiding newer versions of the repository that fix particular issues that they're dealing with. That doesn't make any sense at all. If you're encountering a bug or desiring a feature that's been included in the latest edge version, you're not doing yourself any favors by waiting for the whim of a release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The great thing about open source is that you can control your own release schedule. If you happen to run in to a bug that was fixed 5 revisions past the latest release, you can simply tie your application to exactly that revision and see your problem go away. All the information is available about what changed between the official release and the revision you want to move to. And presumably your test suite will do a reasonable job of catching any adverse changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the main problem is that people do not differentiate between low-level systems, like their OS, web server, or database server, and high-level frameworks like Rails. The latter are never unstable in the traditional sense of the word like the former. The risk of applications crashing with segfaults because of a "bad version" of Rails is incredibly unlikely. So the fear and uncertainty of things just going awry in unexplained ways doesn't belong in this realm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So please do take control of your own release schedule. It's perfectly fine to start off with a released version, but don't dream up dragons and demons lurking in a newer version of edge. Most of the time, edge is of considerably higher quality than the last released version because we've been committing loads of bug fixes since then. Take advantage of that when you can.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Rails 2.0 is out</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yes, yes, I've been awfully quiet here lately. But let's blame that on the long crunch session for Rails 2.0 and call it cheers, ye? It's out, gawd dammit. Finally. After about a year in development and oh-so-many we're-almost-there's. Feels good, does it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I just have to put the final hand on the new screencast for Rails. The current one is awfully stale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So dig in and get it: &lt;a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2007/12/7/rails-2-0-it-s-done"&gt;Rails 2.0&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Rackspace trouble knocks 37signals offline [back!]</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Rackspace has had a major power incident at the data center keeping the 37signals suite of machines. Apparently, a traffic accident knocked power out to some vital cooling systems. When the power was restored through generators, the cooling systems failed to come back online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They now have the cooling systems back up and are getting everything back online. We hope to be back very shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No data has been harmed, the machines were preemptively shut down when the cooling systems failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good number of other applications, such as Wesabe was hit by this as well. Hopefully they'll be back shortly as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/b&gt; Everything is back in working order. &lt;a href="http://37signals.blogs.com/products/2007/11/downtime-explan.html"&gt;Read more on the product blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Swearing at work boosts morale</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Speaking of fuck, &lt;a href="http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=071017125814.w6whem5y&amp;show_article=1"&gt;researchers find it to boost morale at work&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Regular swearing at work can help boost team spirit among staff, allowing them to express better their feelings as well as develop social relationships, according to a study by researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"We hope that this study will serve not only to acknowledge the part that swearing plays in our work and our lives, but also to indicate that leaders sometimes need to 'think differently' and be open to intriguing ideas."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Potty mouths</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm allergic to people who willingly and without irony use the term "potty mouth" in adult conversation. The notion that a word like &lt;i&gt;fuck&lt;/i&gt; can make your brain curl up and cry like a toddler is so pathetically disturbing that it makes my skin crawl. It has the plastic smell of a barbie playhouse and the repressed insecurities of casual friday khakis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't fucking stand it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But at least the potty mouth reaction is a useful leading indicator for personality fits. It's almost as good as the f-bomb reaction. Both are fake euphemisms that are actually much worse than the honest words they're trying to put a fig leaf to. And if you're serious about using them, I'm serious about thinking you're too fucking lame to bother further debate with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which of course is ironic. Since the whole potty mouth fuzz is about distancing yourself from that foul person on the basis of words. Heh. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But at least us sailors recognize that the sea flows both ways. That by using wonderfully flexible joker words like fuck, we're sending a signal of distance to the inevitable crowd who takes offense from that. The potty mouth crowd seems shocked &amp;mdash; &lt;i&gt;shocked&lt;/i&gt; &amp;mdash; that their language could have a similar effect in the opposite direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, fuck it (how great is this word? I seriously considered naming this post "Fuck: The Mother Word" but in the end my despise of the potty mouth term won out just slightly over my affection for the word fuck).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to dive deeper into the wonderful world of cursing, I highly recommend &lt;a href="http://www.tnr.com/docprint.mhtml?i=20071008&amp;s=pinker100807"&gt;What The Fuck: Why We Curse&lt;/a&gt; by Steven Pinker&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S.: See also &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUaWCcDlI5s"&gt;Fuck&lt;/a&gt;, a marvelous tour of the utility of this word.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
