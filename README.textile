h1. AintaBlog: Open Source Tumblogging

h3. "aintablog.com":http://aintablog.com

Aintablog is an open source blogging platform that attempts to combine the cooler parts of tumblr with more traditional blogging mainstays (commenting anyone?) It's not done. It's really not done.

Still, certain things work. You can create new posts (or as we call them, “articles”), quotes, and even import your Twitter feed.

This app isn't quite for beginners (yet?). You need to know your way around a Rails app to really get going. With that being said, if you know Rails, then this app should be a piece of cake.

So fork away, and let me know if you add anything cool.

h3. REQUIREMENTS

You're going to need the feed-normalizer and hpricot gems.

  sudo gem install feed-normalizer hpricot

If you want to run the test suite, you'll need the mocha gem.

  sudo gem install mocha

I think that's about it.

h4. Defensio Spam Protection

Aintablog now has built-in Defensio Spam protection. You need to get API keys from "defensio.com":http://defensio.com, then put them into @config/defensio.yml@.

h4. The tests are hurting

Currently, the tests are in a state of utter disrepair while I figure out how to best integrate them with the new Defensio stuff I added. Stay tuned.

h3. TODO

* Put together a better regex for the spanify_links helper
* -Page titles!-
* Page caching, -Fragment Caching-
* More control over posts (publish_at, -commentable?-)
